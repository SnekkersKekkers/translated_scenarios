Did you know that disaster is brewing?");

the boys around you, lately?");

being delicate about their soft spots, or
showing off how well you get along with
another boy?");

huh? Even if it's just a little

their heart hurt.");

ticking time bomb. And one of the boys
near Mari is like that right now.
